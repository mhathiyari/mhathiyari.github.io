Welcome! I am a Roboticist who works in the Motion Planning and Controls team at Lucid Motors. I have my Master’s from University of Florida in Dynamics System and Controls. I love to write code that makes the robots more effective. “Robots in the wild” has been my guiding mantra for years. Over the past 10 years I have worked on everything involved in building machines from mechanical design, manufacturing, electronics, embedded software and algorithms. I enjoy the products that I work on, hence take on whatever task that are needed for the completion of the product.

I have been fascinated by multi-robot systems for years now and I am planning to go back to school to learn more about them. This page is under construction. So if you want to know more or have any questions please feel free to email me at mustafah "at" ufl "dot" edu.
