Welcome! I am a Roboticist who works in the Motion Planning and Controls team at Lucid Motors. I have my Master’s from University of Florida in Dynamics System and Controls. I love to write code that makes the robots more effective. “Robots in the wild” has been my guiding mantra for years. Over the past 10 years I have worked on everything involved in building machines from mechanical design, manufacturing, electronics, embedded software and algorithms. I enjoy the products that I work on, hence take on whatever task that are needed for the completion of the product.

I have been fascinated by multi-robot systems for years now and I am planning to go back to school to learn more about them. The toggles bellow contain a list of my intrest, click on them to expand and learn more about each.If you want to know more or have any questions please feel free to email me at mustafah "at" ufl "dot" edu.

### Interests
<details>
  <summary>Multi agent systems or Multi robot systems</summary>
<h4>TL;DR</h4>

<p>I am interested in the idea of making multi robot team more efficient and reliable than their single agent counterparts. This involves the study of multi robot path planning, dynamic task assignment, interaction with other agent and humans. My plan is to contribute to these subfields in graduate school and in my career beyond that.</p>

<h4> Why I choose multi agent systems?</h4>

<p>I realized that organic farming is bad for the environment. According to a study published in Nature, organic farms have 15-20% lower yield which leads to more land use and causes deforestation. On the other hand, non-organic farming's excessive use of chemicals causes environmental damage. One way to tackle this problem is to deliver pesticides and fertilizers more precisely, thus reducing their environmental impact. This idea, and my love for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), led me to imagine a future where drones monitor fields, and a team of ground robots mitigate the problem. As I explored this idea more, I realized that naive scheduling and static planning would not work for such an application. Questions of, what happens if one of the robots breaks down? How do we navigate safely amongst humans? And lastly, how do we make robots behave like robust human teams? kept creeping up.</p>

<p>While exploring these questions I got introduced to the field of multi agent system. Since then, I have realized that answering the above question would not only help agricultural robot teams but many other applications such as wildfire management, disaster response etc. Thus, I have chosen to pursue graduate studies in this topic. It will allow me to gain expertise to make multi agent systems a reality in consumer hands.</p>
