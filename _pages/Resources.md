### Who is it intended for?
You can think of it as notes to my past self. It will be highly relevant for people who like motion planning and multiagent systems but will also contain some resources are for people just beginning their journey in Robotics.

For now, the Resources are arranged in no particular order.

### Julia 
* Julia is used by many in academia to prototype algorithms. So i want to know what its all about i suggest checking out this course on [Intro to computational thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/).  
* Also checkout this awesome book [Algorithms for Optimization](https://algorithmsbook.com/optimization) which gives implementation of commonly used optimization algorithms in Julia along with explanations for the same.

### Coding
I have never been convinced with the idea that just by leetcoding you are able to crack coding interviews. Having an systematic understanding is a more elegant solution.   
* [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) is a comprehensive resource that walks you through the process. Don't be intimidated by the size of the repo or the amount of information. Just read through the readme and decide to follow his process or your own inspired version. Good Luck :) 

### Computational Photography & Light field cameras
Have you ever wished to change the focus after taking a picture? With Light field cameras like [Lytro]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytro)  you can do just that. They capture not only incident light intensity but also incident light direction thus allowing us to recompute the image from another focal plane. Its instantaneous depth computation.
* This is a  MOOC on [Computational Photography]( https://www.udacity.com/course/computational-photography--ud955). It introduces you to what its all about.   
* Another beautiful course is on photography but with a more technically inclined perspective by Marc Levoy. He is the guy you want to thank for making amazing features such a night mode and Astro photography a reality on the pixel phones. He is also a pioneer in the field of light field photography. Check out his [Lectures on Digital Photography](https://sites.google.com/site/marclevoylectures/home) to fall in love with the technical complexities of capturing images.
