Today we celeberate Engineers Day in India. Engineering is such a joy and i dont know what my life would be without it. This day celeberates our ability to put a smile on someones face through our machines. A peotry that is really close to my heart is by an anonymous engineer, who pinned it to the site hut of the Konkan Railway construction. This Railway was said to be impossible to build but a few determined engineer made it happen. It is classified globally as one of the most exterme railways and also a scenic one. Riding along the Konkan railway during monsoon is bucket list item for many. Anyway without further ado here is the poem.  


_I take the vision which comes from dreams_  
_and apply the magic of science and mathematics_,  
_adding the heritage of my profession_  
_and my knowledge of nature's materials_  
_to create a design_.  

_I organize the efforts and skills of my fellow workers_  
_employing the capital of the thrifty_  
_and the products of many industries,_  
_and together we work toward our goal_  
_undaunted by hazards and obstacles._  

_And when we have completed our task_  
_all can see_  
_that the dreams and plans have materialized_  
_for the comfort and welfare of all_.  

_I am an Engineer_  
_I serve mankind_  
_by making dreams come true_.  
- Anon (supposedly found pinned to a site hut during the construction of the Konkan railway)
